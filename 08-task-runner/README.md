# 08 – Parallel & Sequential Task Runner

## Goal

Learn how to run async tasks sequentially or with limited concurrency,
while tracking immutable state and exposing a stop() mechanism.

## Modules

- runnerState.js — pure state machine
- taskRunner.js — async task orchestration
- examples.js — console-based test bundle

## Concepts

- async control flow
- sequential vs parallel execution
- concurrency limit
- state transitions
- error-first exit paths
- clean stop/cancel flow

## Usage

See examples.js for runnable scenarios.
