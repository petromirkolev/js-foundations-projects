# Library (JS Logic Focus)

A small “library” app for managing a list of books (CRUD).

UI is intentionally minimal. The goal is to practice **state management, input validation, rendering, and edge cases** in plain JavaScript.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- CRUD operations (add, edit, delete)
- Deterministic state updates (avoid accidental mutation)
- Derived views (filters, search, counts)
- Stable selectors via `data-*` attributes (automation-friendly)
