# Weather App (JS Logic Focus)

Small weather dashboard built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
The goal is to practice **state → render → events** without any framework.

## Features (planned / implemented)

- Search weather by city name
- Display **current weather**:
  - location (city, country)
  - temperature + "feels like"
  - short description (e.g. _clear sky_)
  - humidity, wind, pressure
  - last updated time
- Display a small **forecast list** (e.g. next hours / next days)
- Toggle between **metric (°C)** and **imperial (°F)** units
- Loading and error states (e.g. invalid city, network error)

## Tech stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 (no framework)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no build step)

## How to Run

Open in a browser:

```bash
open index.html (or double-click the file)
```
