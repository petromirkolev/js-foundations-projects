# Todo List (JS Logic Focus)

A small Todo app to practice **state management, filtering, sorting, and event delegation** in plain JavaScript.

UI is intentionally simple to focus on **invariants and predictable behavior**, not styling.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Single source of truth for todos (array of objects)
- Add / edit / delete todo items
- Toggle completed / active
- Filter by status (all / active / completed)
- Search by text
- Sort by created time and text
- Derived counters: total, active, completed

## How to Run

Open in a browser:

```bash
open index.html (or double-click the file)
```
