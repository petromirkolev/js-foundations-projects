# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple JavaScript implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game.

The focus of this project is **basic game logic, control flow, and input validation**, not UI or styling.

---

## What this project demonstrates

- Conditional logic
- Simple state tracking (rounds, score)
- Random choice generation
- User input validation
- Handling edge cases (ties, invalid input, cancel)

---

## How it works

- The player selects a weapon via "prompt"
- The computer selects a random weapon
- Ties do not count as rounds
- The game ends after 3 non-tie rounds
- The winner is determined by score

---

## How to Run

Open the HTML file in a browser, open the browser's console and follow the prompts.

---

## QA Notes

- Invalid input triggers re-prompt
- Ties do not advance the round counter
- Canceling input ends the game
- Randomness uses a uniform selection

---

## Limitations

- No graphical UI
- Uses browser prompts instead of form input
- No automated tests

---

## Why This Project Exists

This project is part of a set of JavaScript foundations exercises used to build logic and reasoning skills for **Manual QA and Automation QA**.
