# JS Foundations Projects

A collection of **small, focused JavaScript projects** built to practice **core JS logic, state management, async behavior, and system reasoning**.

The emphasis is on **correct behavior and debuggability**, not UI polish or frameworks.

Each folder is a **self-contained mini-project**.

---

## What this repo shows

- JavaScript fundamentals (no frameworks)
- State and immutability
- DOM interaction (logic-first)
- Async / await and error handling
- API interaction and failure cases

This repository serves as a foundation for:

- Manual QA
- Automation QA (Playwright)
- API testing

## How to run

Browser-based projects:

- open index.html

Or open the project's live demo from the corresponding README.md file.

## Notes

- Projects favor clarity over cleverness
- State lives in JavaScript, not the DOM
- Errors and edge cases are handled intentionally
- This is a **foundational learning repository**, not a polished product showcase
