# JS Foundations Projects

A collection of small, focused JavaScript projects built while learning core concepts: DOM, events, state, async JavaScript, and API interaction.

This repository is intentionally simple and structured. Each folder contains a self-contained mini-project with its own README and code.

## 📂 Project Structure

01-dom-playground/ → DOM, events, state </br>
02-array-utils/ → Array methods (map, filter, reduce) </br>
03-objects-and-state/ → Objects, functions, modularization </br>
04-async-basics/ → Promises, async/await </br>
05-api-mini-project/ → Fetch API, error handling, rendering results </br>

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal is not to write perfect code.  
The goal is to build practical fluency with:

- DOM manipulation
- event-driven programming
- simple state management
- async flows
- small utilities
- debugging and console workflows

These skills form the foundation for:

- automation testing (Playwright)
- UI testing
- API testing
- building dashboards for IoT/robotics projects

---

## 🧪 How to Run the Projects

Most projects can be opened directly in a browser:

open index.html

For pure JS modules:

node index.js

(Requires Node.js installed.)

---

## 🚀 Upcoming Additions

- localStorage mini-project
- simple calculator
- fetch + UI rendering
- error boundary examples
- unit-testing basics (Jest)
- telemetry dashboard prototype

---

## 📘 Learning Path Alignment

These projects follow the learning progression:

1. JS Foundations
2. DOM
3. Async JavaScript
4. Small Applications
5. Testing & Automation Workflows
