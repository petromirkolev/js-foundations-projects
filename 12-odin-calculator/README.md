# Odin Calculator (JS Logic Focus)

A simple calculator project built to practice **state management, input handling, and edge cases** in JavaScript.

UI is intentionally minimal. The goal is correct behavior and debuggability, not styling.

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Deterministic calculator state (current value, pending operator, previous value)
- Input handling via "data-\*" attributes
- Correct operator behavior (+, −, ×, ÷)
- Decimal handling
- Clear / backspace behavior
- Safe handling of edge cases (e.g., divide by zero)
